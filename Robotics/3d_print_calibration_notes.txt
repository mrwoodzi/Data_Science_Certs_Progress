Calibration Cube MeasureMents:

Current as of 2/5/2024
FlashForge: 
	Left Nozzle Purple
		Z – 19.85mm
		Y – 19.95mm
		X – 20.00mm
	Right Nozzle Orange
		Z – 19.95mm
		Y – 19.95mm
		X – 20.00mm
	Notes:
	Let’s Ask the forums and stop guessing so much
	Slight bit of ghosting on Purple Nozzle and even less on the Orange
	Slight Elephant Footing once First Layer Height was changed
		-I like the first layer squish maybe just always use a raft????
	Top Layers Need to be Adjusted 
	
Current as of 2/5/2024
Ender Pro v.3:
	Z – 19.80mm
	Y – 19.95mm
	X – 20.00mm
	
	Notes: 
	Warren is taking over the Ender Pro 3 printing
Increase Z steps by .40mm??

Systematic Way of Calibration:
    https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/
    Note on Line Width:
        Cura 
            -must use static line widths
                -ex.0.4 nozzle, enter 0.48 instead of 120%

    Layer Consistency:
        -Don't take photos in direct lighting when showing prints, will
            make a good print look terrible
        -High Quality Filaments

    Extruder Calibration:

        Ender:
        Marlin
            Run M503. In the output, find the M92 line and note your current E value.

            Calculate your new e-steps using this formula:
                <new_e-steps> = <current_e-steps> * ( 100 / <actual_extrude_distance> )
            Temporarily set your new e-steps with M92.
                Example: M92 E421.
        Marlin
            Set your new e-steps with M92.
                Example: M92 E421.
            Run M500 to save it to EEPROM.

    Build Surface Preparation & Handling:
        Consider scuffing it up with a kitchen scouring pad.
        This helps immensely, much like how you would scuff/sand a surface before painting 
            or gluing something to it.
        Some people choose not to do this, to keep the glass-like surface finish on their prints. 
            However, you will be sacrificing adhesion and may need to use brims and/or 
            adhesives on occasion.
        ~800-1000 grit sandpaper or the scrubby side of a fresh sponge may also work.
        You can refresh the surface this way on occasion, just remember to wash 
            it again afterwards.

    First Layer Squish:
        ***In General Set First Layer Height to 0.25mm***
        -Calls it squish to be unambiguous. "Z offset" and "z height" can be conflated
            with other concepts
        Prerequisites:
            Marlin: Baby stepping must be :page_facing_up: enabled in firmware. 
                (Most printers have it enabled by default).
