    The Calibration cube above had a scar on the top and models from the previous nights prints were all scared on the 
        top surface below are some issues to check. 

    Retraction Settings: 
        Ensure that your retraction settings are properly configured. Retraction helps to pull filament back 
        into the nozzle when the nozzle is moving across empty spaces, reducing the likelihood of stringing. 
        You may need to adjust the retraction distance and speed in your slicer settings.

    Print Speed: 
        Lowering the print speed, especially during travel movements, can help reduce the likelihood of stringing 
        and dragging. Slower speeds give the filament more time to retract properly before moving to the next position.

    Cooling Settings: 
        Proper cooling can also help prevent stringing. Make sure your cooling fan(s) are functioning 
        correctly and adjust the cooling settings in your slicer if necessary. Printing at lower temperatures may also 
        reduce stringing.

    Z-Hop or Lift on Retraction: 
        Enabling Z-hop or lift on retraction can lift the nozzle slightly while moving between different parts 
        of the print, reducing the chances of dragging across the top layer. This feature is available in most 
        slicer software.

    Check for Mechanical Issues: 
        Ensure that your printer's mechanical components, such as belts, pulleys, and the hotend assembly, are 
        properly calibrated and tightened. Any looseness or misalignment could contribute to dragging or stringing 
        issues.

    Print Temperature: 
        Experimenting with different print temperatures can sometimes help reduce stringing. Lowering the print 
        temperature slightly may reduce the viscosity of the filament and mitigate stringing.

    Ironing Settings: 
        If you're specifically experiencing issues after ironing, double-check your ironing settings 
        in your slicer. Adjusting the ironing flow rate, speed, or other parameters may help improve the finish 
        without causing dragging.

    # The below issue with ABL not working was fixed with a new 32bit board and a new ABL sensor:
        BLTouch not working correctly try following steps:
            G28 is a Home and disable ABL mesh.
            G29 is sense the bed and store in RAM ONLY.
                This is done in Cura in -> preferences -> printers -> Ender -> machine settings -> start G-confidence   
                    -undernearth G28; Home all axes 
                    - G29 ; BLTouch 
                    -M420 S1 ;Load Saved ABL Mesh for BL Touch
            M500 or "save settings" I believe, is save to EPROM non volatile memory so you can retrieve the bed info after a 
                shutdown or reset with...M420 S1 to reactivate the mesh in memory slot 1.
            Check and double check your BL touch wires.

Systematic Way of Calibration:
    https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/
    Note on Line Width:
        Cura 
            -must use static line widths
                -ex.0.4 nozzle, enter 0.48 instead of 120%

    Layer Consistency:
        -Don't take photos in direct lighting when showing prints, will
            make a good print look terrible
        -High Quality Filaments

    Extruder Calibration:
        https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/articles/extruder_calibration.html
        Ender:
        Marlin
            Run M503. In the output, find the M92 line and note your current E value.

            Calculate your new e-steps using this formula:
                <new_e-steps> = <current_e-steps> * ( 100 / <actual_extrude_distance> )
            Temporarily set your new e-steps with M92.
                Example: M92 E421.
        Marlin
            Set your new e-steps with M92.
                Example: M92 E421.
            Run M500 to save it to EEPROM.

    Build Surface Preparation & Handling:
        Consider scuffing it up with a kitchen scouring pad.
        This helps immensely, much like how you would scuff/sand a surface before painting 
            or gluing something to it.
        Some people choose not to do this, to keep the glass-like surface finish on their prints. 
            However, you will be sacrificing adhesion and may need to use brims and/or 
            adhesives on occasion.
        ~800-1000 grit sandpaper or the scrubby side of a fresh sponge may also work.
        You can refresh the surface this way on occasion, just remember to wash 
            it again afterwards.

    First Layer Squish:
        ***In General Set First Layer Height to 0.25mm***
        -Calls it squish to be unambiguous. "Z offset" and "z height" can be conflated
            with other concepts
        Prerequisites:
            Marlin: Baby stepping must be :page_facing_up: enabled in firmware. 
                (Most printers have it enabled by default).
