github link for above tutorial https://github.com/nmccrea/sobot-rimulator



  Build Robots 
  -Learn SOLIDWORKS  
      -Alex designing basic box and working through SOLIDWORKS problems
      -have Warren finish calibrating Ender and start printing basic box
    -Ultimate Goal by May 2024
      -Design and Build very basic battlebots
  -3d print 
    -finish fractal vice
    -get files for battlebots, Christian
  -Coding
    -Figure out Linux and ROS(Robot Operating System)
    -deepen understanding of Python
  -Robotics 
    -Assemble battlebots
    -Maybe start with RF before code?? 

Success: 
  Team Work 
    Printing:
      -Warren in charge of Ender Pro 3v2
      -Chrisitan in charge of his printer
      -Jonathan printing at home with his resin printer 
        -Figure out how to calibrate the resin printer
    CAD:
      Benjamin
        -Learning SOLIDWORKS to design things for us currently and in the Future
