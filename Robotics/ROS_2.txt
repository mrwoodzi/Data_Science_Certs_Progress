    SOURCE THE SETUP FILES:
        source /opt/ros/iron/setup.bash
            -****************************************************************
            -Make sure to source setup files every time you open a new shell
            -without this you will not be able to access ROS 2 commands

    2. If you don't want to source the setup file every time   
        echo "source /opt/ros/iron/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

    3. CHECK ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES  
        printenv | grep -i ROS

Choosing a domain ID:

            -choose domain ID between 0-101, inclusive(highest technically is 232)
                -Linux (0-101) & (215-232)
            -domain ID is used by DDS
    -default middleware that ROS 2 uses for communication is DDS
        -DDS(Data Distribution Service)

        Linux Ports 
            By default, the Linux kernel uses ports 32768-60999 for ephemeral ports. This 
                means that domain IDs 0-101 and 215-232 can be safely used without colliding 
                with ephemeral ports. The ephemeral port range is configurable in Linux by 
                setting custom values in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range. If a custom 
                ephemeral port range is used, the above numbers may have to be adjusted 
                accordingly.
            Ephemeral Ports:
                Ephemeral ports are temporary ports used by the operating system for outbound communication. They are typically assigned 
                dynamically by the operating system from a specific range.In the context of ROS 2 and DDS, these ports are relevant 
                because they are used for communication between different nodes (DDS participants) in a distributed system.

            Default Ephemeral Port Range in Linux:
                By default, on Linux systems, the kernel uses ports 32768-60999 for ephemeral ports. This range is reserved for dynamic 
                assignment to outgoing connections.ROS 2 and DDS need to be aware of this range to avoid conflicts with the ephemeral 
                ports when assigning DDS domain IDs.

            DDS Domain IDs and Ephemeral Ports:
                DDS uses domain IDs to logically separate different communication domains. These domain IDs are assigned numeric values.
                To avoid collision with ephemeral ports, certain domain ID ranges are considered safe. The recommended safe ranges are 0-101 and 215-232.

            Configuration of Ephemeral Port Range:
                The ephemeral port range in Linux is configurable. It can be adjusted by setting custom values in the 
                /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range file. If a custom ephemeral port range is configured, the DDS domain ID ranges considered 
                safe may need to be adjusted accordingly to prevent conflicts with the newly defined ephemeral port range.
