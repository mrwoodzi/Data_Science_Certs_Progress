    Data Pane: 
        On left side of WorkSpace
        -displays all DATA PANES from the data source
            -excel, database, etc . . .
        -DATA PANES have 
            -data source table 
                -each data source table is separated by a line which gives you dimensions    
                -DIMENSIONS
                    -control the measure of aggregation of the measures in a visualization 
                    -ID fields are also dimensions 
                    -can be organized into hierarchies 
                    -above line:
                        -fields that contain qualitative and descriptive values(names, dates, or geographic data)
                    -below line: 
                        -fields that contain numeric, quantitative values can be aggregated using functions(sum/average, etc...)
                -drag fields from the data pane to the shelves and cards to build each visualization 
        -SHELVES
        -CARDS
        -VIEW 
            -data visualization displayed here 
            - 1 vis per sheet 
            -combine sheets to create dashboards and stories
        -TOOLBAR    
            -at the top below File Data Worksheet Dashboard Analysis Map Format Help 
            -access commands, analysis and navigation tools 


    Steps to Create a Dashboard: 
        Open Tableau
        Click Create a Viz 
        Upload or Connect to Data 
        Data Source Page Appears after data is uploaded or connected to 
        Drag a data source to the CANVAS 
        Data Grid will appear below CANVAS
        Click "Update Now" in DATA GRID to display the first 100 rows of data(This might happen automatically)
        NOODLE - when dragging Data Sources onto canvas to create 
            -this will tell you the basic relationship between data sources 
                -many to many
                -inner JOIN
                -Left Join(Left Outer Join)
                -blending
                    -does not require predefined relationships between tables and can be used to combine data based on common
                        dimensions in the data sources 
                    -uses concept of primary and scondary data sources to combine data
