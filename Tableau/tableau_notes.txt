        -FIELDS 
            -data columns? that can be put into the rows or columns in the viz can have DISCRETE or CONTINUOUS values 
                DISCRETE: 
                    -BLUE - turn this color in fields
                    -used for categorical data, where each value represents a distinct category or item.
                    -typically used for categorical data or dimensions. For example, if you have a field called "Region" 
                        with values like "North America," "Europe," and "Asia," labeling it as discrete would mean that 
                            Tableau treats each region as a separate entity, and you'd typically see separate headers or 
                            categories for each region in your visualization.
                CONTINUOUS: 
                    -GREEN - turn this color in fields
                    -numerical data, where values represent points along a continuous scale or range
                    -Date fields are typically set to be continuous
                    -typically used for numerical data or measures. For example, if you have a field called "Sales" with 
                        numerical values representing the sales amount, labeling it as continuous would mean that Tableau 
                        treats the values as points along a continuous scale, allowing for the creation of continuous axes 
                        in visualizations such as LINE CHARTS, SCATTER PLOTS, or HEAT MAPS

                -dynamic values that allow users to control aspects of their analysis or visualizations. 
                    Parameters act as placeholders for a specific value that can be changed interactively 
                    by the user. They enable users to modify certain aspects of the visualization without 
                    having to edit the underlying data or the workbook itself
                -defined to accept different types of values, including integers, floats, strings, dates,

Tableau Stories:    
    Different than dashboards 
    -You can have dashboards in them
    -What is this and can I use it before 

Tableau Prep: 
    This is Tableau's ETL on the Enterprise version 

        Data Cleaning: 
                Tableau Prep allows you to clean your data by removing duplicates, filtering rows, handling 
                    null values, and correcting data inconsistencies.

        Data Aggregation: 
                You can aggregate data using various functions such as sum, average, count, min, max, etc. 
                    This is useful for summarizing data before visualizing it.

        Data Joining and Blending: 
                Tableau Prep enables you to join tables from different data sources based on common fields 
                    or create data blends where relationships are established without a formal join.
                    Difference between JOINING and BLENDING:
                        -A join combines the data and then aggregates. A blend aggregates and then combines the data.
                    JOINING:
                        -where is the data coming from and number of records and connections
                        -if in 2 different databases you can join via a cross database join
                        -if joining multiple tables from same database you can join, which is typically better, which will keep things running fast 
                        -if data is in single source it's better to join it. 
                    BLENDING:  
                        -combining SQL, .CSV OR EXCEL . . . 
                        -main criteria to blend data is that it is going to extract what is needed for performance
                        -should have 1 similar components to blend 

                    Relationships: 
                        Many to Many
                            -requires a junction table 
                        Many to One:
                        One to Many:
                        One to One: 

                    SCHEMA - for database design and analytics:
                        FACT TABLES: - typically numerical measures or facts represent metrics being analyized
                        DIMENSION TABLES: - attributes/categorical fields

                        Dimensional Model:  
                                While the star schema and snowflake schema are specific implementations of the dimensional model, the dimensional model itself 
                                    refers to any structure that organizes data into dimensions and facts for ease of analysis.

                                Star Scheme:
                                        Consists of one or more fact tables referencing any number of dimension tables. The fact table typically contains numerical 
                                            measures or facts that represent the business metrics being analyzed, while dimension tables contain the attributes or 
                                            dimensions by which the facts are analyzed

                                Snowflake Schema: 
                                        This schema is an extension of the star schema where dimension tables are normalized into multiple related tables. This 
                                            normalization can help reduce data redundancy but may require more complex queries to retrieve data.

                                Fact Constellation Schema/Galaxy Schema: 
                                        Also known as galaxy schema, this model consists of multiple fact tables that share dimension tables. It's used when multiple 
                                            fact tables share dimensions but don't directly relate to each other.


                        Third Normal Form (3NF): 
                                This is a normalized schema often used in transactional databases. It eliminates redundant data by breaking down tables into 
                                    smaller, related tables. While not optimized for analytics like star schemas, it's useful for transactional systems to reduce 
                                    data redundancy and ensure data integrity.

                        Denormalized Schema: 
                                In contrast to normalized schemas like 3NF, denormalized schemas store data in fewer tables, which can improve query performance 
                                    but may result in data redundancy. Denormalized schemas are often used in data warehouses for analytics where query performance     
                                    is crucial.

                    

        Data Splitting and Pivoting: 
                You can split columns into multiple columns based on delimiters or pivot data from multiple 
                    columns into rows or vice versa.

        Data Type Conversion: 
                Tableau Prep allows you to change the data type of fields, such as converting strings to 
                    dates or numbers.

        Calculations: 
                You can create calculated fields to perform complex transformations or derive new measures 
                    or dimensions based on existing data.

        Custom Data Cleaning Scripts: 
                Tableau Prep supports the use of custom cleaning scripts written in R or Python for advanced 
                    data manipulation tasks.

        Data Sampling: 
                You can sample data to reduce the size for faster processing or to create test datasets.

        Data Splitting: 
                You can split your dataset into subsets based on certain criteria, which can be useful for 
                    testing or analysis.

        Data Output: 
                Tableau Prep allows you to output your cleaned and transformed data to various formats, 
                    databases, or directly to Tableau Desktop for visualization.

    Post-Mortem Analysis: 
           Campaign Post-Mortem 
                Scrapped a 800-900 page pdf of public voter results compiled by bexar county using Python.
                Got all information from only 1 District and put it in a .txt file, continued cleaning data till it was able to be 
                    turned into a .csv. 
                -turned it into a .csv and then analyzed it via jupyter notebooks. 
                -Several precincts were missing from original data set and while looking at the geo-spatials maps of certain 
                    precincts the precincts from the original dataset were different from the May 6 election results. 
                -missing precincts which are 3037, 3065, 3116, 3127, 3136, 3139 
                -D9 Additional had 3037, 3065, 3127, 3136 
                -D9 Additional has 4 of the 6 precincts. We still need 3116, 3136.  
                - I was manipulating the data and found that only 0.39% of potential voters in 3037 voted. Hhhm that can't be right 
                    so I went back and checked the data some more.  The D9 data has 2839 vuid's in precinct 3037, so I went and looked 
                    at the map for precinct 3037 and there is no way that 2839 vuid could be on that map. I also went to the May 6 pdf 
                    to verify if only 11 people voted and yes that is correct. So my question is how off were the maps and did that have 
                    an effect on your voter turnout and are the maps for the next election going to be different or be the ones that 
                    are currently on the bexar.org website?
