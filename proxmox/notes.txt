Resetting ip address of server and proxmox to allow ssh and remote:
    Change Static NIC in iDrac settings and system setup:
    
    Changing Static in Proxmox:
        nano etc/network/interfaces 
            # there was a misspelling in the interfaces file 
                that kept me on the hunt much longer than I 
                should have been

    Changing ip in browser:
        nano etc/hosts
            ip-address proxmox.local proxmox

    Change firewall rules to allow only certain ips:
        nano /etc/pve/nodes/<node-name>/host.fw


Using Proxmox Regularly
    -need to check and make sure that ssh into the server is still functional
    -multiple drives in RAID 1 set up, probably should set those drives up as a NAS on Proxmox. 
        -*************************************************
        -Well probably won't forget this put NEVER take all/both drives out of a RAID as you 
            will either need to wipe/start fresh with loss of data or go into server bios/setup
            and reactivate the RAID with FOREIGN CONFIGURATION. 
        -Working on saving it by going into proxmox CLI, getting into the drive and finding the file 
            that stores the drive information I need to get. Then resaving that information under the
            ubuntu-server vm  that needs it not the desktop-vm that was associated with the needed data.
        -setting up a NAS is probably a better idea for certain back ups that need to be accessed by multiple machines
    -Once NAS is set up start an instance of S3 as a backup
