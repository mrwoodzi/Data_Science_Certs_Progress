There are several spreadsheet applications available in the 
marketplace; the most commonly used and fully-featured spreadsheet 
application is Microsoft Excel. 

Spreadsheets provide several advantages over manual calculation 
methods and they help you keep data organized and easily accessible. 

As a Data Analyst, you can use spreadsheets as a tool for your 
data analysis tasks. 

There are several elements that make up a workbook in 
a spreadsheet application. 

The ribbon provides access to all the features and tools 
required to view, enter, edit, manipulate, clean, and analyze data in Excel. 

There are several ways to navigate around a worksheet and workbook in Excel. 







Getting Started Using Sheets:
    split - allows you to split into multiple sections and scroll just those sections
    freeze panes/rows/columns
        - 1 row below and 1 column to right of where you want to freeze 
    ctrl + f6 to quickly switch from workbook to workbook 
    ctrl + n new worksheet
    header row - 
    auto center column length - highlight all columns then double click bar inbetween 
    editing existing data 
        - f2 or double click
    Autofill
        -for lots of repetitive data in excel
        -use fill handle
            -cross at bottom right hand corner of cell 
            -numerical or month/day of week
            -it can determine a pattern
            -ex. like every other day 
                Mon 
                Wed 
    Formatting Data - 
        -Formatting cells
            -Bold
            -color
            -cntrl+shift+up key or down key to highlight full row or columns

                    Choose a color to make the table 
            - you can auto format the whole thing here 
    
    
    Basics of Formulas:
        = starts formulas
        then function sum
        then reference('cells function is calculating')
        then operators + - * /
        comparison
        text concatination
        reference
        constants - numbers or values you can reference directly in a formula
            -whole number
            -percentage
            -date 
            
        Basic calculations
            =SUM(E2,E3) or =SUM(E2:E3)
            =SUM(THEN CLICK YOUR MOUSE TO HIGHLIGHT CELLS WANTED)
            Autofill - you can drag a function to any cell
                -double click fill handle(cross bottom right of cell) and it will autofill a whole column 
            AutoSUM - sum average max min or Alt + = Keyboard short cut

        Referencing Data in Formulas:
            Relative
                =A1+A3 blue and red highlighted cell
                    - when moved formula will change there relative position
                -by default excel uses relative References
                -when you reference a cell in a formula, you 
                    are actually referencing its relative position
                -cell references are automatically changed
                    in the copied formula
            Absolute
                -put $ infront of column or row identifier 
                    =$A$1+$A$3
                        -formula stays exactly the same no matter where you move it
                -when you copy a formula containing absolute references
                    the cell references stay the same in the copied formula
            Mixed References 
                =A$1+$A3
                combo of relative and absolute
                =A$+$A3 - absolute column and relative row 
                -when you copy a formula containing mixed references, the relative cell reference
                    changes, while the absolute cell reference stays the same in the copied formula 
            Formula Errors
                #### - can't see a full date/time or something else
                    - not technically an error
                Error codes  
                        -gives a drop down error message 
                    #N/A 
                    #NAME? - using x as multiplication operator
                    #NULL!
                    #REF!
                    #VALUE! 
                    #DIV/O!
