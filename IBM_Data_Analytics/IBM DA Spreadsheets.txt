There are several spreadsheet applications available in the 
marketplace; the most commonly used and fully-featured spreadsheet 
application is Microsoft Excel. 

Spreadsheets provide several advantages over manual calculation 
methods and they help you keep data organized and easily accessible. 

As a Data Analyst, you can use spreadsheets as a tool for your 
data analysis tasks. 

There are several elements that make up a workbook in 
a spreadsheet application. 

The ribbon provides access to all the features and tools 
required to view, enter, edit, manipulate, clean, and analyze data in Excel. 

There are several ways to navigate around a worksheet and workbook in Excel. 







Getting Started Using Sheets:
    split - allows you to split into multiple sections and scroll just those sections
    freeze panes/rows/columns
        - 1 row below and 1 column to right of where you want to freeze 
    ctrl + f6 to quickly switch from workbook to workbook 
    ctrl + n new worksheet
    header row - 
    auto center column length - highlight all columns then double click bar inbetween 
    editing existing data 
        - f2 or double click
    Autofill
        -for lots of repetitive data in excel
        -use fill handle
            -cross at bottom right hand corner of cell 
            -numerical or month/day of week
            -it can determine a pattern
            -ex. like every other day 
                Mon

                    - when moved formula will change there relative position
                -by default excel uses relative References
                -when you reference a cell in a formula, you 
                    are actually referencing its relative position
                -cell references are automatically changed
                    in the copied formula
            Absolute
                -put $ infront of column or row identifier 
                    =$A$1+$A$3
                        -formula stays exactly the same no matter where you move it
                -when you copy a formula containing absolute references
                    the cell references stay the same in the copied formula
            Mixed References 
                =A$1+$A3
                combo of relative and absolute
                =A$+$A3 - absolute column and relative row 
                -when you copy a formula containing mixed references, the relative cell reference
                    changes, while the absolute cell reference stays the same in the copied formula 
            Formula Errors
                #### - can't see a full date/time or something else
                    - not technically an error
                Error codes  
                        -gives a drop down error message 
                    #N/A 
                    #NAME? - using x as multiplication operator
                    #NULL!
                    #REF!
                    #VALUE!

    *****************************Useful functions for Data Analysis:***********************************
        IF - most used logical function
            -compares a value against criteria, then returns a result based
                on a TRUE or FALSE comparison 
            -IF says: "if something is TRUE, return 'X', 
                but if it is FALSE, return 'y'"

    Use of IF to apply one condition
        =IF(A1="text","True","False")
        =IF(A1>3000,"Over 3K","Under 3K")
        -Ideally only use IF for 1 or maybe 2 conditions
Select column AF, right-click, Insert.
In cell AF1, type Complete?.
In cell AF2, type =IF(AE2="Complete","Yes","No") and press Enter.
Double-click the Fill Handle of AF2 to copy down the column     

    NESTED IF to apply multiple conditions:
        -bings together multiple IF statements 
        -theoretically supports up to 64 nested IFS but it is not best practice 
            -large numbers of ifs in a formula is hard to manage and understand 

Select column AE, right-click, Insert.
In cell AE1, type Order Size (IF).
In cell AE2, type =IF(AD2>300,"Large",IF(AD2>100,"Medium",IF(AD2>0,"Small"))) and press Enter.
Double-click the Fill Handle of AE2 to copy down the column.

    Use of IFS to apply multiple conditions (alternative of Nested IF)
        -only supported on excel 2019, excel m365 and excel for web

In cell AE1, type Order Size (IFS).
In cell AE2, type =IFS(AD2>300,"Large",AD2>100,"Medium",AD2>0,"Small") and press Enter.
Double-click the Fill Handle of AE2 to copy down the column.

    Use of COUNTIF to count the number of cells that meet a specified criterion
        -not case sensitive 
        -statistical function
        -COUNTIF counts the number of cell values that meet specified criteria
            -the number of times x shows up in c 
Select cell BX2 and type count VISA card.
Select cell BY2 and type =COUNTIF(N2:N195,"VISA") and press Enter.

    Use of SUMIF function to sum the values within a specified range that meet a specified criterion

Before shaping your data, you need to visualize the final output, and ask yourself the following questions: 
How big is the dataset? 
What type of filtering is required to find the necessary information? 
How should the data be sorted? 
What type of calculations are needed? 
There are several advantages to formatting your data as a table: 
Automatic calculations even when filtering 
Column headings never disappear 
Banded rows to make reading easier 
Tables will automatically expand when adding new rows 

    *********************Using Pivot Tables:*******************************
INTRO TO CREATING A PIVOT TABLE IN EXCEL 
    -You use the Pivot Table Fields pane to add and arrange data fields in your pivot table. 
    -Recommended Pivot Tables are a list of suggested different combinations of data that could be used when 
        creating a Pivot Table, based on the data selected in the worksheet. 
    -filters and formulas can help draw mathematical and logical conclusions about data 
    -not all questions can be answered using filters and formulas alone 
    -to obtain usable and presentable insights into your data your need Pivot Tables 

    -Pivot tables provide a simple and quick way to summarize and analyze data, to observe trends
        and patterns in data and to make data comparisons
    -Pivot tables are dynamic, so as data is changed so does the Pivot table 
    -Data Analyst can use Pivot Tables to draw conclusions about, and create insights into  
        an organization's data
        
        Pivot Table Check List 
            -Format your data as a table
            -Ensure column headings are correct, and there is only one header row
            -Remove any blank rows, columns, and cells 
            -Ensure value fields are formatted as numbers 
            -Ensure date fields are formatted as dates 
            -You typically want to make a Pivot Table on a differ sheet

        Pivot Table Viewpoints:
            -sum, average and count easily 
            -great for a couple thousand records 
            -helps you take lots of data and widdle it down to what you need
