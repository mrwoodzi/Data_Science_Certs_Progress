Describe and differentiate between the role different data professionals play in a modern data ecosystem:

Explain what data analysis is, the different types of data analysis, and the key steps in the data analysis process.

Describe the responsibilities and skillsets of a Data Analyst

Summarize a typical day in the life of a Data Analyst.

Fundamentals of data analysis:
-data gathering
-data wrangling
-mining
-analysis
-data visualization

Modern Data ecosystem:
-pull data from source and put into new database
    -reliability, security and integrity of data at this stage
-organize, clean and optimize, conform to guidelines
    -adhere to master data tables
    -data management, data repositories
-busines stake holders, apps, prog Analyst

Big Data

Data ecosystem:
- data holds key to competitive advantage
data engineer - convert raw data into usable table
    develop and maintain databases, extract, integrate, and organize data from disparate sources
    clean transform and prepare data
    design store and mangage data in repositories
data Analyst: use data to generate insights
    transforms data into plain English
    inspect and clean data
    find patterns 
    statistics
    visualize data
    answer questions, co-relation
data scientist - predict future using data from the past
    analyze data for actionable insights
    create predictive models using machine learning and deep learning
    answer questions like 'How many new social media followers am I likely to get next month.'
    or "What percentage of my customers am I likely to lose to competition in the next quarter."
    or "Is this 
business analyist and bi analyist - use all the above to gain insights and predictions
    leverage work of data analyist and data scientist
    focus on market forces and external influences that shape their business
    organize and monitor data on different business functions
    explore data to extract insights and actionables that improve business performance

Data Analysis:
    Recognizing patterns and correlations in data
        -insghts and conclusion drawn
        -helps to validate a course of actionable

4 types of data analysis:

        Descriptive Analytics
            -what happened in the past
        Diagnostic Analytics
            -why did it happened
        Predictive Analytics
            -predict future outcomes, what might happene
        Prescriptive Analytics
            -what should be done


How to think about analysis:
    Understand the problem and the desired result
    Setting a clear metric, what or how it will be measured
    Gathering data, indentify whats the best tool
    Cleaning data, fix issues in data that could effect accuracy, outliers, standardize data
    Anlyze and Mine data, indentify correlations
    Interpreting results, is analysis defendable
    Presenting your findings

    Also:
        Define problem
        Creating Hypothesis
        Collect and Clean Data
        Analyzing Data
        Presenting to Stakeholders

Defining Data Analysis:
    What is it- 
        Collecting Information - Use of Information
        Analyzing Data
        Confirming Hypothesis
        Storytelling with Data

***Difference between Analysis and Analytics:
        -Analysis - detailed examination of the elements or structure of something, can be done without numbers or data
        -Analytics - the systematic computational analysis of data or statistics

        -Comm effectively
        -story telling
        -curiosity
        -intuition - ability to have sense of future

Day in the life of Data Analyst:
    -Asquiring data
    -Create queries
    -looking for insights
    -updating dashboards and reports 
    -interacting with Stakeholders for gathering Information and presenting findings 
    -clean and prepare data for analysis

    Initial Hypothesis  
    Identifying Datasets
    Find potential issues
    Present to stakeholders and also present the methods used to get to solution

Application of Data Analytics   
    -used by companies to identiy what information consumers want them to share
    -its everywhere 
    -widely applicable across industries, verticals and functions within
    -used to pay close attention to changes in customers buying habits

The role of a Data Analyst spans across:

    Acquiring data that best serves the use case.

    Preparing and analyzing data to understand what it represents.

    Interpreting and effectively communicating the message to stakeholders who need to act on the findings.

    Ensuring that the process is documented for future reference and repeatability.  

In order to play this role successfully, Data Analysts need a mix of technical, functional, and soft skills.  

    Technical Skills include varying levels of proficiency in using spreadsheets, statistical tools, visualization tools, 
    programming and querying languages, and the ability to work with different types of data repositories and big data platforms.

    An understanding of Statistics, Analytical techniques, problem-solving, the ability to probe a situation from multiple 
    perspectives, data visualization, and project management skills â€“ all of which come under Functional Skills a Data Analyst 
    needs in order to play an effective role.

    Soft Skills include the ability to work collaboratively, communicate effectively, tell a compelling story with data, and 
    garner support and buy-in from stakeholders. Curiosity to explore different pathways and intuition that helps to give a 
    sense of the future based on past experiences are also essential skills for being a good Data Analyst.
