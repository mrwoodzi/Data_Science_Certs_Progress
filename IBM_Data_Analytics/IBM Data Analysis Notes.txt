    clean transform and prepare data
    design store and mangage data in repositories
data Analyst: use data to generate insights
    transforms data into plain English
    inspect and clean data
    find patterns 
    statistics
    visualize data
    answer questions, co-relation
data scientist - predict future using data from the past
    analyze data for actionable insights
    create predictive models using machine learning and deep learning
    answer questions like 'How many new social media followers am I likely to get next month.'
    or "What percentage of my customers am I likely to lose to competition in the next quarter."
    or "Is this 
business analyist and bi analyist - use all the above to gain insights and predictions
    leverage work of data analyist and data scientist
    focus on market forces and external influences that shape their business
    organize and monitor data on different business functions
    explore data to extract insights and actionables that improve business performance

Data Analysis:
    Recognizing patterns and correlations in data
        -insghts and conclusion drawn
        -helps to validate a course of actionable

4 types of data analysis:

        Descriptive Analytics
            -what happened in the past
        Diagnostic Analytics
            -why did it happened

            -predict future outcomes, what might happene
        Prescriptive Analytics
            -what should be done


How to think about analysis:
    Understand the problem and the desired result
    Setting a clear metric, what or how it will be measured
    Gathering data, indentify whats the best tool
    Cleaning data, fix issues in data that could effect accuracy, outliers, standardize data
    Anlyze and Mine data, indentify correlations
    Interpreting results, is analysis defendable
    Presenting your findings

    Also:
        Define problem
        Creating Hypothesis
        Collect and Clean Data
        Analyzing Data
        Presenting to Stakeholders

Defining Data Analysis:
    What is it- 
        Collecting Information - Use of Information
        Analyzing Data

        Storytelling with Data

***Difference between Analysis and Analytics:
        -Analysis - detailed examination of the elements or structure of something, can be done without numbers or data
        -Analytics - the systematic computational analysis of data or statistics
