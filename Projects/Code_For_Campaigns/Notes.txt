Sept. 18, I am working campaign things with data sets that are not public
    -spent 5hrs working on Cognos dashboard trying to find insights 
        -but realized data was in complete
        -spet a lot of time trying different files and they were all outdated files
        - I did do a little analysis vis and realized 1 of the precincts is very small  
            200ish voters but only 5 voted

Sept. 19
    -Spent a lot of time on the campaign finds insights and manipulating data   
        -realized that the precincts from the d9 file are not geographically the same 
            as the may 6 pdf
                -Did they use the wrong maps?
            -this also meant that I will not push forward on much else 
                in terms of analysis till I get the detailed
                data set from May 6
