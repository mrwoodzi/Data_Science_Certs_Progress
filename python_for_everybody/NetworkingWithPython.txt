TCP -  Transport Control Protocol / Sockets
    built on top of ip 
    assumes IP might lose some data so store and retransmits data if it seems to be lost 
    handles "flow control" using a transmit window
    provides a reliable pipe 
    an internet socket or network socket is an endpoint of bidirectional inter-process communication lfow 
        accross an Internet Protocol-based computer network, such as the internet 
    Socket - is a data phone call

ASCII - Amercan Standard Code for Information Interchange pronounced "AssKey"
    characters are put into 8 bit binary 
    8bits = byte 

Ordinal/ord = function in py that can tell you the number value of a simple ASCII character 

Unicode - character code like ascii that is huge 
    unicode is much larger, 4x larger than ASCII 
    UTF-32 is pretty much unicode 
    Python 3 is all strings are Unicode 

UTF- 8 is the preferred way to exchange data between systems
    dynamic length of 1-4 bytes
    ASCII file is UTF-8
