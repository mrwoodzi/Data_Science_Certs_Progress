#Strings
#All Strings in Python3 are in Unicode
#when trying to print strings and add them my concatenation try [(f'{whatever})]

for n in "banana":
    print(n)


# using in as a logical operator

fruit = 'banana'
print(n in fruit)
print('m' in fruit)
print('nan' in fruit)
if 'a' in fruit:
    print('Found It!')

# STRING COMPARISON
# case can mess up the comparison

    print('Alright, bananas')

if word < 'banana':
    print('Your word', + word + ', comes before banana.')
elif word > 'banana':
    print('Your word,' + word + ', comes after banan.')
else:
    print('All right, bananas.')
