    above link has been super use in starting to understand OOP in pythonlikeyoumeanit

Here we will encounter three varieties of methods:

    instance methods: defined whenever a function definition is specified within the body of a class

    class methods: A class method is similar to an instance method, but it has a class object passed as its first argument.

    static methods

class Category:
    __init__(self, name): # creates an instance object - food = Category("Food")
