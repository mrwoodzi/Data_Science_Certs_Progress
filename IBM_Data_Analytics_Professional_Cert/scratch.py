a = int('E', 17)
print(a)

int function has two optional parameters, one the string representation of a integer value and 
second a base. In this case E in base 17 its a number.
the equivalence between base 10 and 17 is:
10---17

a = [1, 2, 3]
y = a
Ð£[1]= 4
print(a)
this creates a SyntaxError maybe due to a shallow or deep copy issue
