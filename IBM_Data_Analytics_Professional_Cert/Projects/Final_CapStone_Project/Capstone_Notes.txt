As a Data Analyst, you will be assisting with this initiative and have been tasked with collecting 
data from various sources and identifying trends for this year's report on emerging skills. 

Your first task is to collect the top programming skills that are most in demand from various 
sources including:
Job postings
Training portals
Surveys
Once you have collected enough data, you will begin analyzing the data and identify insights and trends 
that may include the following:
What are the top programming languages in demand?
What are the top database skills in demand?
What are the popular IDEs?
You will begin by scraping internet web sites and accessing APIs to collect data in various formats like 
.csv files, excel sheets, and databases.   
 
Once this is completed, you will make that data ready for analysis using data wrangling techniques. 
 
When the data is ready you will then want to apply statistical techniques to analyze the data.  
Then bring all of your information together by using  IBM Cognos Analytics to create your dashboard. 
And finally, show off your storytelling skills by sharing your findings in a presentation.
You will be evaluated using quizzes in each module as well as the final project presentation.


Data Wrangling or Munging is a process in which we clean up the data 
    set and make it ready for data analysis. In this assignment you 
    will perform the following tasks:
Identify duplicate rows in the data frame.
Remove duplicate rows from the dataframe.
Find the number of missing values for all columns.
Find the value counts for the column "Employment".
Normalize the data using two existing columns.  


After cleaning the dataset, your next step is the analysis. In this stage 
    you will become more familiar with the data set and it will start to 
    take shape. In this assignment you will:
Plot a distribution curve, and histogram.
Find the median, and outliers of particular columns.
Compute the Inter Quartile Range.
Find out the upper and lower bounds, and find correlations between numerical columns.
Create a new dataframe.

In this assignment you will now show off your visualization skills by working with 
    the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019 dataset. In this assignment you will:
Create a histogram to show the distribution of data.
Create different plots such as a scatter, bubble or boxplot.
Create a pie chart, bar chart, and stacked chart to show medians and counts.
