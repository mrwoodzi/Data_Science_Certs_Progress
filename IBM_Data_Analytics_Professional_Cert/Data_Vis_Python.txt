Week 2 - Basic and Specialized Visualization Tools
    Area Plots - 
        like a line plot but with colors in between lines 
        Displays magnitutide and proportion of multiple variables 
        typically represents time or another ordered dimension 
        Is based on the line plot  
        used to compare 2 or more quantities 
        depicts totals using numbers or percentages over time.
    Histograms 
        -x axis/ horizontal is the numeric categories(0-120203939)
        -y axis/ veritical is how many times those numeric categories accure
        -partitions numeric data into bins 
        -assigns each data point in the dataset 
        -counts the number of data points 
        - Histograms illustrate the distribution of data within 
        specific intervals, allowing us to understand its shape and concentration
    Bar Charts 
        - Bar plots compare categories or groups, providing 
        a visual comparison of their values
        -typically compares a variable at a given point in time 
        -*** You can pass a list of different or repeat alternating colors
            to a list 
            c = ['list', 'of', 'a', 'bunch', 'of', 'different', 'colors']
            df.plot(kind = 'bar', color =c, edgecolor = 'black')
    Pie Charts
        -circular statistical graphic divided into segments to illustrate 
            numerical proportions
    Box Plots 
        - 5 primary dimensions 
            minimum
            first quartile 
            median
            third quartile
            maximum
        - Box plots display the distribution of data, 
        showcasing the median, quartiles and outliers
        - Best used when comparing 5 dimensions of different categories/subjects

    Scatter Plots 
        ***these work different than some of these others when 
        actually using code to plot them.
            You have to set your x and y parameters in the beginning 
            df.plot(kind='scatter, 
                x='column1',
                y='column2')
                **It takes the columns in a dataframe and doesn't 
                    auto-set everything 
        - Scatter plots explore relationships between 
        variables, helping us identify correlations or trends
        -typically 2 variables 
        -determines correlation between 2 variables 
    Bubble Plots
        -Variation of the Bubble Plot 
    Line Plots  
        displays relationship between two continuous variables over a 
            continuous interval, showing the trend or pattern of the data

            performs a groupby on a categorical variable and plot
            aggregated values with confidence intervals 
            (kinda looks like a partial box plot???)

Matplotlib
    -Originally a ECoG Visualization tool 
    3 Main Layers 
        back-end
            FigureCanvas
                encompases the area onto which the figure is drawn 
            Renderer
                Knows how to draw on the FigureCanvas
            Event
                Handles user inputs such as strokes and mouse clicks 
        artist layer 
            Comprised of one main object - Artist 
            artist  
                Uses Renderer to draw on canvas 
                    Title, lines, tick labels, and images 
                2 Types of Artist Objects:
                    Primitive:
                        Live2D, Rectangle, Circle, and Text 
                    Composite: 
                        Axis, Tick, Axes and Figure 
                Figure and Axes(Artist Objects) hold most of the methods that are defined in 
                    Matplotlib
                Each composite artist may contain other composite artists as 
                    well as primitive artists

        Artist Layer Using It 
            Object Oriented method
            This is for programmers
            used to access more advanced ascpects of the plots
            from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg as FigureCanvas
            from matplotlib.figure import Figure
            fig = Figure()
            canvas = FigureCanvas(fig)

            #create 10000 random numbers using numpy
            import numpy as np 
            x = np.random.randn(10000)

            ax = fig.add_subplot(111) # create an axes artist 

            # add a title to the figure and save it 
            ax.set_title('Normal distribution with $\mu=0, \sigma=1$')
            fig.savefig('matplotlib_histogram.png')

        Scripting layer 
            Called the "Procedural method"
            using 
                matplotlib.pyplot as plt
            Designed for Scientist who are not programs 
            Comprised mainly of pyplot, scripting interface that is lighter than
                the Artist layer
            - higher level interface built on top of the Artist Layer
                ***********************************************
            the entire Matplotlib library uses the Artist layer. The scripting 
            layer (pyplot) is just a part of the Matplotlib library that provides 
            a simpler interface for quickly creating plots without the need to 
            interact with the underlying Artist layer components directly. When 
            you use functions like plt.plot(), plt.bar(), or plt.xlabel(), you 
            are essentially creating and manipulating Artist layer objects without 
            needing to manage them explicitly. The pyplot functions internally use 
            the Artist layer to construct and modify the elements of the plot.
            # This does the same
            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
            import numpy as np 

            x = np.random.randn(100000)
            plt.hist(x, 100)
            plt.title(r'Normal distribution with $\mu = 0, \sigma = 1$')
            plt.savefig('matplotlib_histogram.png')
            plt.show()
    
    Line Plots 
        type of plot which displays information as a series of data points called 'markers' 
            connected by straight line segments 


    Area Plot 
        Also known as Area Chart or Area Graph 
        

GroupBy 
    Split 
    Combine 
    Apply 




Folium 
    Maps Library for Python
    x = longitude # negative number on ourside of the world
    y = latitude # positive North of Equator 

Plotly
    you can create line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, 
    pie charts, 3D plots, and Choropleth maps, to name a few

PyWaffle
    you can create waffle charts, square pie charts, 
    donut charts, and many more types of plots by providing 
    a unique way to represent proportions
