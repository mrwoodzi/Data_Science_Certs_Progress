Matplotlib
    -Originally a ECoG Visualization tool 
    3 Main Layers 
        back-end
            FigureCanvas
                encompases the area onto which the figure is drawn 
            Renderer
                Knows how to draw on the FigureCanvas
            Event
                Handles user inputs such as strokes and mouse clicks 
        artist layer 
            Comprised of one main object - Artist 
            artist  
                Uses Renderer to draw on canvas 
                    Title, lines, tick labels, and images 
                2 Types of Artist Objects:
                    Primitive:
                        Live2D, Rectangle, Circle, and Text 
                    Composite: 
                        Axis, Tick, Axes and Figure 
                Figure and Axes(Artist Objects) hold most of the methods that are defined in 
                    Matplotlib
                Each composite artist may contain other composite artists as 
                    well as primitive artists

        Artist Layer Using It 
            This is for programmers
            from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg as FigureCanvas
            from matplotlib.figure import Figure
            fig = Figure()
            canvas = FigureCanvas(fig)

            #create 10000 random numbers using numpy
            import numpy as np 
            x = np.random.randn(10000)

            ax = fig.add_subplot(111) # create an axes artist 

            # add a title to the figure and save it 
            ax.set_title('Normal distribution with $\mu=0, \sigma=1$')
            fig.savefig('matplotlib_histogram.png')

        Scripting layer 
            Designed for Scientist who are not programs 
            Comprised mainly of pyplot, scripting interface that is lighter than
                the Artist layer
            
            # This does the same
            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
            import numpy as np 

            x = np.random.randn(100000)
            plt.hist(x, 100)
            plt.title(r'Normal distribution with $\mu = 0, \sigma = 1$')
            plt.savefig('matplotlib_histogram.png')
            plt.show()
    
    Line Plots 
        type of plot which displays information as a series of data points called 'markers' 
            connected by straight line segments 


    Area Plot 
        Also known as Area Chart or Area Graph

Folium 
    Maps Library for Python
    x = longitude # negative number on ourside of the world
    y = latitude # positive North of Equator 

Plotly
    you can create line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, 
    pie charts, 3D plots, and Choropleth maps, to name a few

PyWaffle
    you can create waffle charts, square pie charts, 
    donut charts, and many more types of plots by providing 
    a unique way to represent proportions
