General calculus history:

    ****************************************************************************
    ****Idea of looking at an approximation and seeing what happens in the limit
            is the central core concept of calculus**********************

    Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
        -discovered independently by Newton and Leibniz, 17th century 
        -reveals connections between areas and slopes of tangent lines

    Tangent Lines:
        -a tangent line to a curve at a specific point is a straight line 
            that just touches the curve at that point. Mathematically, it's 
            defined as the line that best approximates the behavior of the 
            curve near the given point. The slope of the tangent line at that 
            point is equal to the derivative of the function representing the 
            curve at that specific point. This derivative gives the rate at 
            which the function is changing at that particular point. The 
            tangent line provides a local linear approximation to the curve 
            around the chosen point.

        -leads to theory and solutions of differential equations
        -ubiquitous throughout sicience



Isacc Newton:
    -worked out the escape velocity of a rocket, 11 kilometers per second
    -calculation involved the theory of calculus, that he'd only just invented

Function:
    -process or rule that finds connections or relationships between
        different physical quantities or measurements

Limits:
    -precise mathematical tool for connecting finite object

Differential calculus

    -Techniques of differential calculus lead to profound insight
    -discovered in 17th century

    Derivatives:
        -limit point:
            -Ex: sides of a road converging to a singular point in the distance, but the 
            sides of the road remain the same distance apart always, yet they 
            seem to meet at infinite

            -when limits are combined with ratios or rates of changes, particular 
                types of fractions, the we obtain derivatives and the theory of 
                differential calculus.

Integral Calculus:
    -uses limiting processes but applied to areas


Real Line: 
    -extend on a line infinitly on a line left and right
    -sqrt(2)


    Decimals: 
        decimal expansion

            -Rules of decimal approximation:

                1. When adding or subtracting, quote your answer to the least 
                    number of decimal spaces
                        Ex. Line
                            9.4 + 2.13 = 11.53 
                                -you really don't need the .03 in 2.13 since 
                                    9.4 doesn't have a .00, round it
                                -answer == 11.5
                        Ex. 
                            9.4 - 2.13 = 7.27    
                                -don't need the .00, round it
                                -answer == 7.3
    
                2. When multiplying or dividing, quote your answer to the least
                    number of significant figures 
                        Ex. Rectangle

            -can't use infinite decimal expansion in real life 
            -we use decimal approximation for infinite decimal 
            -1/2 expands to 0.5
            -3/2 expands to 1.5
            -1/3 to 0.33333........333333......
            -6/7 to 0.857142.......857142......
            -sqrt(2) to 1.41421 but never repeats
                -never a fraction
                -said to be irrational
            -pi to 3.14159
                -never a fraction
                -defined to be the ration of the perimeter to the diameter
                -P = perimeter of circle 
                -D = diameter of circle 
                -pi = P/D 
                    -take any circle do P/D and you get pi
                    -true because all circles can be approximated arbitrarily well, 
                        using similar triangles, and it's a fact from geometry that 
                        ratios of corresponding sides of similar triangle are equal.
