pandas- conerstone of our data analysis job with python
matplotlib - the foundational library for visualizations. 
numpy - the numeric library that serves as the foundation of all calculations in python
seaborn - A statistical visualization tool built on top of matplotlib
statsmodels - a library with many advanced statistical functions
scipy -  advanced scientific computing, including functions for optimization, linear algebra, 
    image pocessing and much more
scikit-learn - the most popular machine learning library for python(not deep learning)

What is a dataframe?
    The rows and columns that make up the data

What does the loc method allow you to do?
    Acces a group of rows and columns by label(s) or a boolean array


To Run JupyterLab: python -m jupyterlab
How to Install NumPy: py -m pip install numpy
Juypter Notebooks:
    ecosystem of tools

    **Everything is a Cell**
    Markdown - is a text formatting tool
        -can return a formatted document
    Cell can be  a markdown, code, raw 
    It is a mode based editor
        -esc key switches mode to command
        -return key switches mode to edit
        -behavior of cell changes depending on mode
        -command mode - manipulating outside cells 
        -edit mode - manipulating inside cells
    Add Cell:
        a to create above selected or b to create cell below selected
    Delete Cell: 
        dd 
    Cut: x
    Paste: v 
    Copy: c 

    Make cell Markdown with m 
    Make cell Code/Python with y 
    Executing code cntrl and return 

    Different option over MatPlotLiv is Bokeh: has interactive charts

            -link to a good low level explanation of numpy
            -review how to find out how many bits for a specific array
        Over 20yrs old
        useful linear algebra, Fourier transform and random number capabilities
        tools for integrating c/c++ and Fortran code
        a powerful N-dimensional array object
        efficient numberic computation with C primitives

        processing numerical numbers is slow on large data sets in Python
        Numpy solves this Python issue
        Numpy is mostly for porcessing numerical Arrays


        Example:
            import numpy as np
            np.int8(actually gives a bytes list of potential bytes in drop down)

    
    **Can do something new called multi indexing
        You can have multiple dimensions
        Square Matrix:             0  1  2
        square_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],  0
                                  [4, 5, 6],  1
                                  [7, 8, 9]   2 
                                  ]) 
            
            across[:,  down :]
