    How do I do this?

        MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients):
            -MFCCs are a popular feature extraction method for speech and audio processing. They 
                involve taking the Mel spectrogram, applying a logarithm, and then performing a 
                discrete cosine transform (DCT) to obtain a compact representation of the spectrum.
            -robust to noise and environmental variations.

        Chroma Features:
            -Chroma features capture the harmonic content and distribution of energy in different pitch classes (i.e., 
                musical notes) over time. They are particularly useful for tasks involving music 
                analysis, such as chord recognition and music genre classification.
            -They are particularly useful for distinguishing between different bird species 
                based on their vocalizations.

        Spectral Contrast:
            -Spectral contrast measures the difference in energy between peaks and valleys in the 
                spectrum. It provides information about the spectral texture of audio signals and 
                is often used in music genre classification and audio segmentation.

        Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR):
            -ZCR measures the rate at which the audio signal changes sign (crosses the zero amplitude axis) 
                over time. It can be used to estimate properties such as pitch and timbre and is commonly 
                used in speech and music processing tasks.

        RMS Energy:
            -Root Mean Square (RMS) energy measures the average energy of the audio signal over time. It 
                provides information about the overall amplitude or loudness of the signal and can be used 
                for tasks such as audio event detection and speech recognition.

        Pitch and Spectral Centroid:
            -Pitch represents the perceived frequency of a sound, while spectral centroid measures the center 
                of mass of the frequency spectrum. These features are useful for tasks involving pitch estimation 
                and sound source localization.

        Time-Domain Features:
            -Time-domain features include statistical measures such as mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of 
                the audio signal. These features provide information about the temporal characteristics of the signal 
                and can be used for various audio analysis tasks.


        Potential Path: 
            Feature Extraction: 
                -Extract MFCCs, Chroma features, and spectral contrast features from the bird call recordings using a library like librosa.
                -time domain & pitch/spectral centroid extraction  - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271608436_Design_and_Implementation_of_an_Audio_Classification_System_Based_on_SVM
                -mfcc, high zero-crossing rate ratio, low short-time energy ratio, frequency energy
            Feature Preprocessing:
                Normalize the extracted features to ensure that they have zero mean and unit variance.
            Feature Vector Construction:
                Concatenate the MFCCs, Chroma features, and spectral contrast features to form a single feature vector for each bird call sample.
            Labeling:
                Assign labels to the bird call samples based on their corresponding bird species.
            Training the SVM Classifier:
                Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
            Train an SVM classifier using the combined features as input features and the corresponding labels as target labels.
                Evaluation:
            Evaluate the performance of the trained SVM classifier using the testing data.
                Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the classifier's performance in classifying bird calls.

            -SVM notes:
                -parameter tuning is very important with svm 
                -maybe,  "For multi-class, the most popular choice is one-vs-all classification"

        
        General Notes on Audio Classification:
            The  audio  classification  and  recognition  research  consists  of  three  fundamental  disciplines: 
                sound event recognition, popularly known as ESC [15], automatic recognition of  speech  [16],  
                and music category classification [17]. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345260947_Efficient_Classification_of_Environmental_Sounds_through_Multiple_Features_Aggregation_and_Data_Enhancement_Techniques_for_Spectrogram_Images
