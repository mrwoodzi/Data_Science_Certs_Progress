To push the changes from your VM-server branch to the main branch, you will need to 
    # didnt realize my local branch wasn't up to date with remote local 
    1. merge the VM-server branch into the main branch and 
    2. push the updated main branch to the remote repository. 
        git switch VM-server
        git pull origin VM-server 
        git switch main 
        git pull origin main
