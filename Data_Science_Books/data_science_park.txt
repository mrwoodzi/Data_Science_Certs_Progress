Decision Trees
    -it is an algorithm
        -if this, then that, else that
    -can handle numerical and categorical data 
    -great for exploring data   
        -helps to find variables and making connections between variables
    -helps to clear away the outliers for more accuratek predictions 
        -outliers: 
            -noise that reduces the accuracy of you predictions 
            -typically have a small impact on desicion trees
    -Issues
        -Overfitting
            -sometimes create cery complicated decision trees that will have 
                issues generalizing data due to their complexity
            -if no limits imposed 100% accuracy score occurs 
                -impose limits on development and branches
                    -min_samples_split
                    -min_samples_leaf
                    -max_features
                    -max_depth
                -Pruning:  
                    -used to nearly eliminate overfitting
                    -eliminate branches that do not help with the classification process

            -overfitting creeps in when the algorithm seeks to eliminate the training errors
                but by doing so increases the testing errors. 
                    -this leads to terrible predicition accuract
        -conitnuous numreical data
            -continusous variavle can be a value that is set to be within a range of numbers
                -ie: people between the ages of 18 and 26 being considered students
            -problem at categrization 
    
    Regression Trees and Classification Trees   
        -Classification Trees   
            -implemented when there is a categorical dependent variable
            -result = mode of the total relevant observations
                -any observations that we cannot define will be predicted based on this value, which represents
                    the observation which we identify most frequently  
        -Regression Trees   
            -implemented in the case of a continuous dependent variable 
            -result = mean of the total relevant observations 
                -unidentified observations are declared with the mean value which results from the known 
                    observations
