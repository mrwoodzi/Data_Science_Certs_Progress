Occam's Razor 
    "All things being equal, a simpler model should be used 
        in preference to a more complicated model."

Correlation 
    relationship between strength of association
Regression  
    Quatifies nature of the relationship between variables


Simple Linear Regression    
    -relationship between magnitude of one variable(Y)
        and that of a second(X)
        -how much will Y change when X changes
        -tries to find the best line to predict response 
        Y = response, dependent variable, target
        X = predictor, feature


Multiple Linear Regression 
    -multiple predictors(X) 

Stepwise Regression - also known as backward elimination
    -start with full model and successively drop variables that 
        don't contribute meaningfully

All sub-set Regression  
    -search through all possible models

Below 3  are classic statistical regression metrics, are all "in-sample":
R^2 - R squared
    -measures proportion of variation in the data 
        that is accounted for in the model
F-statistics
p-values


b`0 - b zero
        -also called the intercept or constant
b'1 - b one 
        -slope of X 



fitted values 
    -predictions, Y-hat 
residuals 
    -prediction errors
