What is Machine Learning:
    Inductive Inference
    Machine Learning   
        -used for estimating relationships
    An AI domain where we extract patterns from the data and analyze 
        the data and make intelligent predictions on the new data
        according to the pattern your machine has learnt
    How machines extract patterns?
    How we analyze the data?
    How machines make predictions?
    Tom Mitchell
        "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T 
            and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, 
            improves with experience E."
    Experience -> Task -> Performance -> Improve -> Performance -> Improve 

    Experience  
        -can be past data
    Task    
        -the prediction you are trying to make 
    Performance 
        -how well your model is performing on new and unseen data
    Improve 
        -feedback

Linear Regression:
    -extracting patterns

    Example:
        Prepare a marketing plan for a Car Company
            -manufacturer of the car
            -model of the car 
            -engine size of car 
            -horsepower of the car 

        Making a market plan    
            -recommend which info of the car to highlight
                -to make the most of Stakeholders
            Is there a relationshiop between info of the car and sales?
            How strong is the relationship between info of the car and sales?
            Which info contributes to sales?
            How accurately can we estimate the effect of each info on sales?
            How accurately can we predict the sales?
            Is the relationship linear?
