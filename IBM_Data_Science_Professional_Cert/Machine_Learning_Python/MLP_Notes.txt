What is Machine Learning:
    Inductive Inference
    Machine Learning   
        -used for estimating relationships
    An AI domain where we extract patterns from the data and analyze 
        the data and make intelligent predictions on the new data
        according to the pattern your machine has learnt
    How machines extract patterns?
    How we analyze the data?
    How machines make predictions?
    Tom Mitchell
        "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T 
            and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, 
            improves with experience E."
    Experience -> Task -> Performance -> Improve -> Performance -> Improve 

    Experience  
        -can be past data
    Task    
        -the prediction you are trying to make 
    Performance 
        -how well your model is performing on new and unseen data
    Improve 
        -feedback

Linear Regression:
    -extracting patterns

    Example:
        Prepare a marketing plan for a Car Company
            -manufacturer of the car
            -model of the car 
            -engine size of car 
            -horsepower of the car 

        Making a market plan    
            -recommend which info of the car to highlight
                -to make the most of Stakeholders
            Is there a relationshiop between info of the car and sales?
            How strong is the relationship between info of the car and sales?
            Which info contributes to sales?
            How accurately can we estimate the effect of each info on sales?
            How accurately can we predict the sales?
            Is the relationship linear?

Machine Learning is the subfield of computer science that gives "computers the ability to learn without 
        being explicitly programmed"

        Define "without being explicitly programmed."


Major Machine Learning Techniques:
Regression:
    -predicting continuous values
Classification:
    -predicting class or category of a cases 
Clustering:
    -finding the structure of data; summarization
    - ex., grouping of similar cases in a dataset, for example to find similar patients, or for customer segmentation in a bank 
Associations:
    -associating frequent co-occurring items/events
Anomaly detection:
    -discovering abnormal and unusual cases 
Sequence mining:
    -predicting next events; click-stream (Markov Model, HMM)
Dimension Reduction:
    -reducing the size of data (PCA) 
Recommendation systems:
    -recommending items


Python Libraries for Deep Learning:
    Numpy
        images
        functions
        data types
    SciPy
        -signal preprocessing
        -optomization 
        -statistics
    Matplotlib
        -plotting package that provides 2d plotting and 3d plotting
    Pandas 
        -high level library 
        -data structures, analysis, structures 
        -operations for maipulating numerical tables and timeseries
    SciKit Learn 
        -machine learning library
        -collection of algorithms 
        -Popular among data scientist
            -free 
            -has most of the typical classification, regression and clustering algorithms
            -design to work with numpy and scipy 
            -good documentation
            -it's easy 
        -pre-processing of data 
        -feature selection
        -freature extraction
        -train test splitting
        -defining the algorithm 
        -fitting models 
        -tuning parameters
        -prediction 
        -Evaluation
        -exporting model 


*****************Supervised Algorithms vs. Unsupervised Algorithms**************
column_names = attributes
column_data = features
row = observation

2 types of Supervised Learning:
Classification  
    -process of predicting a discreate class label or category
Regression
    -process of predicting a continuous value 

Unsupervised Learning Techniques:
    -draws conclusions on unlabeled data 
    -clustering
        -used for grouping data points or objects that are somehow similar 
        -also used for discovering structure, summarization and anomaly detection 
    -dimension Reduction
        -reduces redundant features to make the classification easier
    -density estimation 
        -explores the data to find some particular structure 
    -market basket analysis 
        -theory that if you buy a certain group of items, you're more likely to buy another group of items
