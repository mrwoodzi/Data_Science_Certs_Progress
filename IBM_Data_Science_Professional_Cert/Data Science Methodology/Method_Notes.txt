I did get started today but mostly read and didn't take notes so I could spend time 
thinking about it.
I will slow this course down compared to the others so I have more time 
to ingest what I am reading.

Type I Error (False Positive): This occurs when you reject a true null hypothesis 
    (a statement that should be accepted) in favor of an alternative hypothesis (a statement 
        that should be rejected). It's essentially a "false alarm."

Type II Error (False Negative): This occurs when you fail to reject a false null hypothesis. 
    In other words, you miss a genuine effect that exists in the population. It's often 
        called a "miss."

Type III Error (Less Common): Type III errors are less commonly used terminologies, and 
    they are not as standardized as Types I and II. Type III errors typically refer to 
        situations where the researcher or analyst makes an error in the direction of an 
            effect. For example, if the researcher incorrectly believes that a treatment 
                had a positive effect when it had a negative effect. Type III errors are 
                    not as widely recognized or used as Type I and Type II errors.

Data Modeling 
        models are based on the analytic approach that was taken, 
            either statisticaly driven or machine learning driven
    Descriptive model
    Predictive model  
    Training Set
        historical data in which the outcomes are already known
        gauge to determine if the model needs to be calibrated 

    John Rollins' descriptive Data Science Methodology
        1. understand the question 
        2. select analytic approach or method to solve problem
        3. obtain, understand, prepare and model data 
        end goal is to move data scientist to a point where a 
            data model can be built to answer the question

    From problem to approach:
        What is the problem that you are trying to solve?
        HOw can you use data to answer the question
    Working with the data:
        What data do you need to answer the question?
        Where is the data coming from (identify all sources), and   
            how well you get it?
        Is the data that you collected representative of the problem 
            to be solved?
        What additional work is required to manipulate and work with 
            data?
    Deriving the answer:
        In what way can the data be visualized to get to the 
            answer that is required?
        Does the model used really answer the initial question, 
            or does it need to be adjusted?
        Can you put the model into practice?
        Can you get constructive feedback into answering the 
            question?

Hospitals need to ensure that patients receive timely and 
high quality care and also not have staff standing around 
with nothing to do during down periods. Therefore the hospitals 
need to schedule their staff, doctors, nurses and other 
personnel to improve patient care, reduce cost, higher 
employee satisfaction and efficient resource allocation.
How can a hospital optimize it's scheduling so that the hospital 
is not under or over staffed during any given period of time?

Analytic Approach:
Data Driven Approach

Data Requirements:
Patient Data: Collect data on patient admissions, discharge times, and peak admission hours. This data will help identify demand patterns.
Staff Data: Gather data on staff availability, skills, preferences, and contractual constraints. This data will help in understanding the workforce.
Historical Scheduling Data: Access historical scheduling records to understand how scheduling has been done in the past.

Data Collection:
Acquire patient data from the hospital's admission and discharge records.
Collect staff data from HR records, including availability, skills, and preferences.
Retrieve historical scheduling data from previous schedules and records.

Data Understanding and Preparation:
Data Cleaning: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values and outliers. Ensure consistency and accuracy in the data.
Feature Engineering: Create relevant features such as patient admission patterns, staff skill levels, historical scheduling data, and staff shift preferences.
Data Integration: Combine patient and staff data to understand the relationships between patient demand and staff availability.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to visualize data patterns, correlations, and any seasonality in patient admissions.

Modeling and Evaluation:
Model Selection: Choose an appropriate modeling technique for staff scheduling optimization. Options include linear programming, integer programming, reinforcement learning, or custom algorithms.
Model Development: Develop the chosen model based on the data. Implement optimization constraints to account for staff availability, skills, preferences, and contractual obligations.
Evaluation Metrics: Define key performance metrics, such as staff utilization, patient wait times, cost-effectiveness, and compliance with labor laws.
Model Training: Train the model using historical data and real-world scenarios to fine-tune parameters.
Model Testing: Test the model with sample data and evaluate its performance against the defined metrics.
Deployment: Implement the scheduling system into the hospital's workforce management software. Ensure it can handle real-time data and adapt to changing conditions.
Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously monitor the scheduling system's performance and make necessary adjustments as patient demand patterns evolve.
