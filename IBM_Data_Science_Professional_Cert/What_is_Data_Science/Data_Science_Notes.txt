Getting Started with Data Science:

"The other key ingredient for a successful data scientist is a behavioral trait: curiosity. A data scientist 
has to be one with a very curious mind, willing to spend significant time and effort to explore her hunches. 
In journalism, the editors call it having the nose for news. Not all reporters know where the news lies. Only
those Who have the nose for news get the Story. Curiosity is equally important for data scientists as it is for journalists."

Rachel Schutt is the Chief Data Scientist at News Corp. She teaches a data science course at Columbia University. 
She is also the author of an excellent book, Doing Data Science. In an interview With the New York Times, Dr Schutt 
defined a data scientist as someone who is a part computer scientist, part software engineer, and part statistician 
(Miller, 2013). But that’s the definition of an average data scientist. “The best”, she contended, “tend to be really 
curious people, thinkers who ask good questions and are O.K. dealing with unstructured situations and trying to find 
structure in them.”

How Big Data is defined by the Vs: Velocity, Volume, Variety, Veracity, and Value.
How Hadoop and other tools, combined with distributed computing power,  are used to handle the demands of Big Data.  
What skills are required to analyse Big Data. 
About the process of Data Mining, and how it produces results.

Big Data V's:
Velocity 
VolumeVariety 
Veracity 
Value

Distributive Analysis:
Apache Spark
Hadoop - Google big data architecture 
    mapper process/map 
    reduce process 

Digital Transformation 
    affects business operations 
    updating existing processes
    operations 
    creating new operations 

Deep Learning vs. Machine Learning:
    Data Mining 
        -process of automatically searching and analyzing data, discovering previously unrevealed patterns
    Machine Learning    
        -subset of AI that uses computer algorithms to analyze data and make 
            intelligent decisions based on what it has learned without being explicitly programmed 
        -traind with large sets of data and they learn from examples 
        - do not follow rules based algorithms 
        -enables machines to solve problems on their own and make accurte predictions using the provided data 
        -Netflix recommendations 
    Deep Learning 
        -Specialized subset of machine learning that uses layered neural networks to simulate human decision making 
        -algorithms can label and categorize information and identify patterns 
        -enables AI systems to continuously learn on the job and improve  the quality and accuracy of results by determining 
            whether decisions were correct 
        -Neural Networks collection of small computing units called neurons that take incomeing data and 
            learn to make decisions over time
            -ofter layer deep and are the reason deep learning algorithms become more efficient  as the data 
                sets increase in volumne, as opposed to opther machine learning algorithms  that may plateau as data increases

    ********************
    Data Science 
        -process and method for extacting knowledge and insights from large volumes 
            of disparate data. 
        -interdisciplinary field involving mathematics, statistical analysis, data vis., 
            machine learning and more 
        -makes it possible to appropriate information, see patterns, find meaning from large volumes of data 
            and use it to make decisions that drive business
        -broad term that encompasses the entire data processing methodology 
    AI 
        -everything that aloows computers to learn how to solve problems and make intelligent decisions

Neural Networks vs Deep Learning:
    Neural Network 
        -a computer program that will mimc how our brains use neurons to process
    Deep Learning   
        -neural networks on steroids
        -lots of linear algebra calculations 
            -transformations
        -High Powered Computational resources 
        -classifications
        -Bayesian Analysis 
        -have to understand what the meanings of predictive techniques
