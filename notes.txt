Operators:
"is" and "is not"
    Python has an "is" operator that 
    can be used in logical expressions

    implies "is the same as"

    similar to, but stronger than ==

    "is not" is also a logical operator

    use "is" for booleans and None types, no floats variables and strings 
For Example: **************************
 0 is 0.0 = False because it's stonger than == and demands that type and value are ==
