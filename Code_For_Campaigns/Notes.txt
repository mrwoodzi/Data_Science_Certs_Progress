Sept. 18, I am working campaign things with data sets that are not public
    -spent 5hrs working on Cognos dashboard trying to find insights 
        -but realized data was in complete
        -spet a lot of time trying different files and they were all outdated files
        - I did do a little analysis vis and realized 1 of the precincts is very small  
            200ish voters but only 5 voted
